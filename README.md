#### I. The project was based on a 1360x760 display of the original site. It was not prepared to be responsive and no queries were used.

#### II. The layout is based in a CSS-based layout with floats.

#### III. The main areas of the project can be divided as follows:

  ###### &nbsp; The sectioning
  It was created by identifying each section in the main document. Each of them has been enclosed by using html elements and their corresponding border properties.

  ###### &nbsp; The picture elements
  The relevant pictures from the original site have been represented by placeholders of similar size.

  ###### &nbsp; The feature sections
  The heatmap has been created by coloring the sections in a grayscale, according to how they capture reader's attention.

  ###### &nbsp; The text
  The main text has been represented both by similar size and font. To detach meaning the dummy text has been taken from fragments of text in Latin.
